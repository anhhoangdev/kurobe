- ❌ Integration with engine system
- ❌ Panel generation and persistence

### 3. Database Integration

- ❌ Connection pool for multi-database support

## Recent Discoveries

### Architecture Insights
1. **Engine Registry Pattern**: The project uses a sophisticated pluggable engine system with YAML configuration
2. **Question-Driven Flow**: Each question becomes a session that generates multiple panels
3. **Multi-Database Support**: Architecture supports PostgreSQL, Trino, and DuckDB through unified connection pool
4. **Enterprise Focus**: Comprehensive RLS, audit logging, and observability built-in

### Code Structure Analysis
- **Backend**: Well-structured FastAPI application with clear separation of concerns
- **Frontend**: Modern Next.js setup with shadcn/ui and comprehensive tooling
- **SDK**: Separate package for client integration following Kortix patterns
- **Configuration**: YAML-driven engine configuration with hot-reload capability

## Current Challenges

### 1. Engine Implementation Gap
The engine registry exists but lacks concrete implementations. Need to:
- Create base engine interfaces
- Implement Anthropic/OpenAI text-to-sql engines
- Build rule-based visualization engine
- Add semantic analysis engine

### 2. Missing Service Layer
Database schema exists but no service layer to interact with it:
- Need SQLAlchemy models
- Database service implementations
- Connection pool management
- Query execution service

### 3. Frontend-Backend Integration
- API endpoints defined but not fully implemented
- Frontend components exist but no real data integration
- SDK needs to match actual API implementation

## Next Development Session Goals

### High Priority
1. **Backend API Integration**: Connect new question interface to backend APIs
2. **Engine System Completion**: Implement actual question processing pipeline
3. **Panel Generation Service**: Transform questions into panel specifications
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket/SSE for live question processing

### Medium Priority  
1. **Question Processing Pipeline**: Connect QuestionInterface to backend engines
2. **Panel Persistence**: Save and retrieve generated panels
3. **Dashboard Builder**: Allow pinning panels to create persistent dashboards
4. **Data Source Integration**: Connect to actual databases

### Low Priority
1. **Advanced Visualizations**: Implement Recharts integration
2. **Collaboration Features**: Sharing and team functionality
3. **Export Capabilities**: Panel and dashboard export options

## Architecture Decisions Pending

### 1. Engine Interface Design
**Question**: What should the standard interface look like for engines?
**Considerations**: 
- Need to support different engine types (text-to-sql, visualization, semantic)
- Should be async throughout
- Need standardized error handling
- Configuration injection mechanism

### 2. Query Result Format
**Question**: How should query results be structured for panel generation?
**Considerations**:
- Need to support multiple database types
- Metadata for visualization recommendations
- Performance for large result sets
- Caching strategy

### 3. Panel Specification Format
**Question**: What's the optimal structure for panel specifications?
**Considerations**:
- Frontend rendering requirements
- Storage efficiency
- Extensibility for new chart types
- Configuration flexibility

## Development Environment Notes

### Current Setup
- **Backend**: FastAPI with basic structure, missing core implementations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL schema ready, needs service layer
- **Frontend**: Next.js setup complete, needs API integration
- **Docker**: Development environment configured

### Key Files to Focus On
1. `backend/app/engines/registry.py` - Engine system core
2. `backend/app/services/questions.py` - Question processing logic
3. `config/engines.yaml` - Engine configuration
4. `backend/app/schemas/models.py` - Data models
5. `backend/app/core/database.py` - Database configuration

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for engine implementations
- Integration tests for question processing
- API endpoint testing
- Frontend component testing

## Collaboration Notes

### Code Patterns to Follow
- Async/await throughout backend
- Comprehensive type hints
- Structured logging with context
- Pydantic models for validation
- Error handling with custom exceptions

### Documentation Needs
- Engine development guide
- API documentation
- Database schema documentation
- Deployment guide

The foundation is solid, and the next phase focuses on implementing the core engine system and question processing pipeline to make the platform functional.
