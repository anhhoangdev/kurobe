## Recent Discoveries

### Architecture Insights
1. **Engine Registry Pattern**: The project uses a sophisticated pluggable engine system with YAML configuration
2. **Question-Driven Flow**: Each question becomes a session that generates multiple panels
3. **Multi-Database Support**: Architecture supports PostgreSQL, Trino, and DuckDB through unified connection pool
4. **Enterprise Focus**: Comprehensive RLS, audit logging, and observability built-in

### Code Structure Analysis
- **Backend**: Well-structured FastAPI application with clear separation of concerns
- **Frontend**: Modern Next.js setup with shadcn/ui and comprehensive tooling
- **SDK**: Separate package for client integration following Kortix patterns
- **Configuration**: YAML-driven engine configuration with hot-reload capability

## Current Challenges

### 1. Engine Implementation Gap
The engine registry exists but lacks concrete implementations. Need to:
- Create base engine interfaces
- Implement Anthropic/OpenAI text-to-sql engines
- Build rule-based visualization engine

## **Strategic Decision: Backend Integration Priority**

The frontend provides an excellent foundation with professional UI/UX and complete functionality. The next logical step is **backend integration** to make the chat interface actually process real data and generate meaningful visualizations.

**Why Backend Integration Next?**
1. **Validates Core Value Proposition**: Users can perform actual data analysis
2. **Demonstrates Innovation**: Question-driven BI becomes functional
3. **Enables User Testing**: Real feedback on the core concept
4. **Foundation for Growth**: Other features build on working data pipeline

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Start with simple Text-to-SQL engine (Anthropic Claude)
- Connect to single database (PostgreSQL) first
- Generate basic panels (tables, simple charts)
- Expand to multiple engines and databases incrementally

The architecture is well-designed and the frontend is production-ready. Time to make it actually work with real data!
