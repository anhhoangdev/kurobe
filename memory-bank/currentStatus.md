### ❌ Frontend-Backend Integration (0%)

**API Implementation:**
- Question processing endpoints with real business logic
- Real-time status updates during processing
- Panel generation and persistence
- Connection management and health checks

**Data Flow:**
- Connect chat interface to working backend APIs
- Transform frontend mock data patterns to real API calls
- Implement WebSocket/SSE for real-time updates

- Thread-based context management (vs isolated queries)
- Natural language to visualization pipeline (vs SQL expertise required)

### Technical Readiness
The foundation supports **rapid business logic implementation**:
- API endpoints defined and ready for implementation
- Database schema complete with proper relationships
- Frontend components ready to consume real data
- Configuration system ready for engine management

### Competitive Advantage
Current implementation demonstrates **innovation potential**:
- ChatGPT-style interface adapted for BI use cases

   - Error handling for malformed SQL

2. **Question Processing API**
   - Connect frontend chat submission to real backend
   - Implement question-to-panel pipeline
   - Basic panel generation (tables, simple charts)

3. **Database Integration**
   - SQLAlchemy models for core entities
   - PostgreSQL connection and query execution
   - Basic result processing and caching

**Success Criteria:**
- User can ask a question and get a real data visualization
- Thread conversations are persisted in the database
